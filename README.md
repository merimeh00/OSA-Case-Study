# OSA-Case-Study-Repository
This repository contains code for analyzing data and implementing different classification techniques to detect Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA). The project is developed for ETSIT, UPM.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
In the ["EDA"](/EDA) folder, you'll find R code for data preparation and exploratory data analysis.

## Machine Learning Models
The ["Models"](/Models) folder contains code for various machine learning models used in this project:

- Linear Regression: Predicts the Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI) value of a patient.
- Classification Models: Utilized for inferring the severity of the disease. Additionally, classification code is provided for distinguishing diseases into respiratory or non-respiratory categories using GPT-2 and BERT.

## Data
The ["Data"](/Data) folder houses two essential files utilized throughout the project:

- InfoBDApneaQuironMalaga.xlsx: This file contains raw, unorganized data that underwent reorganization, analysis, and cleaning processes.
- OSA_extreme_male.xlsx: This file specifically contains data pertaining to male patients with severe cases of OSA or individuals considered healthy.
